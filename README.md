# ASDMB Tutorial: Basics

## What You'll learn

- Set up a closed-loop AutoRA workflow: Learn how to create an automated discovery process, iterating between hypothesis generation and data collection.
- Create and fit models using [PsyNeuLink](https://princetonuniversity.github.io/PsyNeuLink/)
- Experimental design with [SweetPea](https://sites.google.com/view/sweetpea-ai)
- Generate behavioral experiments with [SweetBean](https://autoresearch.github.io/sweetbean
- Host online experiments using [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/?gclsrc=aw.ds&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=12211052842&gbraid=0AAAAADpUDOiuq_e0WNsTtWpy3FY8bLTF3&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIg5HztvbijwMVOBWtBh2S9zWTEAAYASAAEgJvCvD_BwE)
- Collect data from participants with [Prolific](https://www.prolific.com/)

## Prerequisit

- **Google Account**. We will use Firebase to host our experiments and store data. For this, you will need a (_free_) Google Account. For the tutorial, it is best to use a personal Google Account rather than a university-provided one, since institutional accounts often restrict the admin access required for the setup.
- **GitHub Account.** To follow this tutorial,a (_free_) GitHub account is recommended. We will use GitHub Codespaces to provide a consistent environment and minimize setup friction. You are welcome to use your own coding environment instead, but please note that we cannot guarantee full compatibility across all environments.

## Quickstart

- Creata a Github repository from this template
- Open the repo in codespace
- Open the [slides/index.md](slides/index.md) file in preview mode and follow instructions
