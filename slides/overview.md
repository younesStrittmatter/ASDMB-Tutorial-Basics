## Study Overview

In this example study, we are interested in **cognitive control**. We will use a **Stroop Task** to measure congruency effects. Participants will see color words written in different colors and have to react to the color (not the meaning). We will measure accuracy differences in congruent (color==meaning) vs incongruent tasks.
