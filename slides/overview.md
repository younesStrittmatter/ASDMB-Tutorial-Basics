## Study Overview

In this example study, we are interested in **cognitive control**. To examine this, we will use a **Stroop Task**, in which participants see color words displayed in different ink colors and must respond to the color rather than the wordâ€™s meaning. Performance is compared between congruent trials (e.g., the word <span class="colored red">RED</span> shown in red) and incongruent trials (e.g., the word <span class="colored blue">RED</span> shown in blue), allowing us to measure accuracy differences that reflect congruency effects.
